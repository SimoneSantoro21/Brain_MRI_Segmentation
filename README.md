## Overview
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, leading to demyelination and subsequent neurodegeneration. It manifests through a wide range of neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances, muscle weakness, coordination problems, and cognitive deficits. The progression and severity of MS can vary significantly among individuals, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment.
Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI can be used in the detection of MS lesions.
Accurate segmentation of MS lesions is essential for both diagnosis and research purposes. In diagnosis and monitoring, precise identification and measurement of lesions aid in diagnosing and tracking its progression. In research, high-quality segmentation is crucial for studies aiming to understand the pathophysiology of MS and develop new therapeutic approaches.
